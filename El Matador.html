         Featherweight Champion and the first Georgian fighter to win a UFC championship. As of July 30, 2024, he is #4 in the UFC men's pound-for-pound rankings.
         Topuria was born in Halle Westfalen, Germany. to Georgian parents who were refugees from Abkhazia. 
         At the age of seven, Topuria moved to Georgia with his family and started practicing Greco-Roman wrestling at a local school. 
         After the Russo-Georgian War, at the age of 15, they once again relocated, this time to Alicante, Spain.

          Initially coming into the UFC organization with a strong base in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, Topuria dedicated himself to enhancing his stand-up game,
           developing a boxing-heavy approach under the guidance of experienced coaches. His boxing style is marked by precise shot selection, fluid combinations,
            and remarkable power, which was on full display during his knockout victories over Max Holloway and Alexander Volkanovski in 2024.
             Topuria's execution of boxing is strategic, using his footwork and positioning to set up clean, fight-altering punches. He has cited the Mexican boxing style,
              particularly that of Canelo √Ålvarez, as a major inspiration for his striking, adapting its principles to mixed martial arts.</h2>
